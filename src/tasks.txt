//TODO: Figure our how to get ratings for movies into sage...

//TODO: Look at updating airing date for imported media.  I think I should probably overwrite the import date.

//TODO: Add a play, delete and other options to the unknown media files page

//TODO: Research why weird media files are showing up in the unknown files
This appears to be an issue with Medusa and CouchPotatoe updating the file with a higher quality, and deleting the .properties file.  This is my best guess
//TODO: Relookup any media files that are missing metadata at the end of a library import scan.  This should reduce the chance of the above

//TODO: Add options to the unknown media file pages to refresh metadata and scan media file


//TODO: Add paging to the details pages
//TODO: Performance enhancements....

Completed:
Make a page for managing unknown files
Redo the movies detail page in the new style
