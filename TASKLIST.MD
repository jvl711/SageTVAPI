**TODO**
- Figure our how to get ratings for movies into sage...
- Look at updating airing date for imported media.  I think I should probably overwrite the import date.
- Add a play, delete and other options to the unknown media files page
- Research why weird media files are showing up in the unknown files
    - This appears to be an issue with Medusa and CouchPotatoe updating the file with a higher quality, and deleting the .properties file.  This is my best guess
- Relookup any media files that are missing metadata at the end of a library import scan.  This should reduce the chance of the above
- Add options to the unknown media file pages to refresh metadata and scan media file
- Add paging to the details pages
- Performance enhancements....

**Completed:**
- Make a page for managing unknown files
- Redo the movies detail page in the new style
